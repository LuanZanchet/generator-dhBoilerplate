## Intro
That's my own YO Generator who fits for my own requirements.
Last year I go most of the time with CodeKit and a more oldsql workflow.
Now, this one is more up to date :)

Big thanks to [Sascha Fuchs](https://github.com/gisu) and his [Kittn](http://kittn.de/) for a lot of help and inspiration.
Also big thanks to [Martin Herweg](https://github.com/martinherweg) and his [YO Generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-mh-boilerplate) that help me a lot too.
And last but not least thanks to all members from our Slack Channel [webdevs](http://webdevs.xyz/) â€” feel free to join us.


## What is inside
This three scenarios are covered by the generator:

- Prototyping (with Twig)
- WordPress with a basic Starter Kit (WordPress itself must be Installed from Hand after the first `gulp init`)
- Craft CMS with a basic index.twig (Craft CMS itself must be Installed from Hand after the first `gulp init`)

Next Steps are integrate Hearty for Craft CMS and a Craft CMS Starter Kit and Hearty for WordPress.


## Install
```
$ npm install -g generator-dhboilerplate
```


## Usage
Jump in your Working Directory and type:

```
yo dhboilerplate
```
Run through the options. When you're done grab a coffee. The node module installation take a while :)


## Commands
Intialize your Project simple with `gulp init`


### Default Task with BrowserSync

```
gulp
```


### Task for Building
This Task clean the folder, build the stuff from ground up and optimize the images and minifiy JS / CSS files. Ready for live!

```
gulp build
```
